# TrueRVs - Modern RV Trading Website Redesign

This project is a modern, minimalist redesign of an RV trading website with a focus on user experience and aesthetics.

## Project Overview

TrueRVs is a platform for buying and selling recreational vehicles (RVs) with the following key features:

- Modern, minimalist design with intuitive navigation
- Instagram-style dealer profile pages
- Integrated AI helper for assisting users in finding the right RV
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Colors**: Dark blue (#1e3a8a), black (#121212), and various shades of grey
- **Accent Color**: Pastel orange (#ffa07a) for highlights and call-to-action elements
- **Purpose**: The dark color scheme gives a premium, sophisticated feel while the pastel orange provides a warm, attention-grabbing contrast

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Poppins (weights 300, 400, 500, 600, 700)
- **Purpose**: Clean, modern sans-serif font that's highly readable on all screen sizes

### Layout
- **Card-Based Design**: Clean, consistent card layout for both RVs and dealers
- **White Space**: Generous spacing between elements for better readability and focus
- **Grid System**: Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
